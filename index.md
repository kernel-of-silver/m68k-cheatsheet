This is my personal website for Motorola 68000 and Sega Mega Drive related information. If you're lurking, this probably should not be referenced for actual information unless I've become some master assembly programmer.

Most of the information here is referenced from [MarkeyJester's Motorola 68000 Beginner's Tutorial](https://mrjester.hapisan.com/04_MC68/). I also have friends that do this stuff too, so some information here might be from them.

Check the sidebar for the actual content.
